# Angular simple CRUD example
This project is a stripped down version of my Angular Dashboard Starterkit Template: https://github.com/fransyozef/basic-login-angular

The authentication part is stripped out, just leaving the "Items" feature.

## Why?
The purpose of this project is a little demonstration about how to 
- structure your components
- do CRUD api calls

I've also written a Medium article with some information: https://medium.com/@fransyozef/angular-dashboard-starterkit-template-cruding-it-8a87080bb01

## What's in this project?
- Bootstrap 4 (https://getbootstrap.com/)
- Angular 6 (https://angular.io/)
- A fake backend service to handle the api request
- Angular Routing system
- Some RxJS function (http://reactivex.io/) 
- Feature "Items"   : Add / Delete / Edit items using CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) methods

## Install and run this project
